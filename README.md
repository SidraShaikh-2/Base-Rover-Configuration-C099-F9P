# Base-Rover-Configuration-C099-F9P
This is the tutorial for setting up two Ublox GNSS C099-F9P boards as Base &amp; Rover communication Wireless with RTK corrections.

# Highlights
• Application board for ZED-F9P  
• Flexible connectivity options, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth  
• Arduino Mega shield connections for host expansion  

# Product description
The C099-F9P application board allows efficient evaluation of ZED-F9P, the u-blox F9 high precision positioning module. The ZED-F9P module provides multi-band GNSS positioning and built-in RTK technology providing centimeter-level accuracy to users. The C099-F9P application board integrates the ZED-F9P module and includes an ODIN-W2 short-range module for connectivity options.
The application board is designed to support the evaluation of the ZED-F9P module, while the ODIN-W2 module provides wireless connectivity capabilities for everyday use cases. Refer to the C099-F9P User Guide for details on supported configurations. The u-center evaluation software provides a powerful platform for
the evaluation of u-blox GNSS receivers. With U-center, data can be logged and visualized in real-time. The u-center software contains an NTRIP server/client which can be used to manage the RTCM correction stream to and from a C099-F9P application board.
